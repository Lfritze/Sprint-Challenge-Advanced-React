// NOtes ****
// Although this isnâ€™t something you will often do (storing input values in localStorage), this setup is quite powerful, and it effectively demonstrates how composable hooks can be; by combining the stateful logic of multiple custom hooks, you can compose a really nice custom hook with advanced stateful logic.

// One final thing to note is that we can employ the useLocalStorage custom hook in other places now as well. So, not only do we have an extra-powerful useInput created by composing multiple hooks together, we also have another custom hook available to us anytime we want to persist data in localStorage.
